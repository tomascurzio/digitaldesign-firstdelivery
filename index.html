            <p>This year, 2024, we're doing the first edition of the new and highly regarded Buenos Aires International Film Festival (BAIFF). We invite you to be a part of this new era of the film community in the biggest city of Argentina.</p>

            <h2>Challengers by <br> Luca Guadagnino</h2>
            <p>Tashi, a tennis player turned coach, has transformed her husband from a mediocre player into a world-famous grand slam champion. To jolt him out of his recent losing streak, she makes him play a challenger event -- close to the lowest level of tournament on the pro tour. Tensions soon run high when he finds himself standing across the net from the once-promising, now burnt-out Patrick, his former best friend and Tashi's former boyfriend.</p>
